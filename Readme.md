In the first version of this project we are collecting and visualising Corona data with simple exponential and logarithmic fits. However, big data is omnipresent and it is worth to get behind all the magic. Thus, we develop tools to read, visualise and analyse data in general. This might find day to day application and should answer questions like, <where to invest my money?>.
We plan to use D3.js for interactive plots. Another idea is to incorporate machine learning algorithms in the analysis procedure.

Getting started:
Clone the repository and make sure you have the newest python version installed. A sufficient python environment can be created via conda: conda env create --name py34 --file requirements.txt. Run the jupyter notebook file in the terminal and execute the cells to get the plots in the browser window.
